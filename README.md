# EmployeeDatabase

In this repositor is the project done according to the requirements and user stories given to be in the pdf.
I was unsure how it was desired to be presented shared and the like, and I am lacking in general experience in using things such
as github, as noted here but should be remedied in the future.

# Environment
all of the work done here was completed in pycharm using python version 3.9, and uploaded my project workspace here from the pycharm virtual environment.
the main file that was completed with all the main work within it is located venvScripts/EmployeeDBControl.py where the lions share of the project was completed.
the project was completed used the modules SQLite3 for the database management, Tkinter for building the gui and interactive functions, and a few other misceilanoious
things. Everything was then exported, built and shrunk down to a singular rar that can be unpacked to where desired, and run the short cut that should point to the
main exe that was built to run it all. Otherwise the program can be ran by the files by the afforementioned .py file in a similarly rebuilt environment. 
For all intents and purposes, the release.rar is the only thing that is being released here that will run standalone and function as intended.

# Important files
/venv/Scripts/EmployeeDBControl.py - Main python file where everything was built

Final Product/release/dist/EmployeeDBControl/EmployeeDBControl.exe -  This or the shortcut to actually run the file.

# How to use
when the program is running the following should be noted.
- to do anything you must log in.
- you may register by typing in a desired username, password, and email, then click register.
- the program will prompt you to restart the application after clicking okay.
- after that you are free to log in and do as you need.
- to see updates within the database, simply click the refresh table button.
- the delete record button will delete the employee via their ID on the left, or simply double click on the row.
- Update employee will update the record of the employee given by the id, and from the filled in above values.
- double clicking on a target will auto fill all of these values for you.
- You may also simply type in a Name Job Title and date of hire to add in an employee to the database.
- Each action you do is logged in the notifications section listing the action done, to whom, and when.

# Closing Notes
Overall I hope this project given is satisfactory and fufills the needs or at the least shows promise worth investing in. Thank you for your time.
